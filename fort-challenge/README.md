# Fort Challenge

Code for the first Engineering team challenge of GHP 58. Teams of ~6 were tasked with building a fort out of foam core that met the following specifications:
- offensive ability to launch tennis balls weighted with sand at least 10 feet
- defensive ability to protect 3 eggs from launched tennis balls
- BONUS: auto-aim and/or auto-fire of weapon (if red cup hit, bonus points)
- eggs had to be 6 inches off the ground and fort had to be at least 18 inches long

The FORT ended up having no offensive capabilities, and so the code in this folder could not be integrated.
