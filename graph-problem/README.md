# Problem 1: Implement a Graph and a List of Methods

The graph should have:
- Vertices/Nodes
- Edges
- adding a vertex
- adding an edge
- get neighbors of a vertex
- get incident edges of a vertex
- an is_reachable function that returns whether a given node is reachable from another

*Challenge: find an is_reachable function that runs in O(1) time. Preprocessing may take longer, but running the actual
search algorithm should take O(1).*
